# VTSaR Dataset
We have conducted a comprehensive APD dataset labeled as ”VTSaR”, which stands out from the existing publicly accessible APD datasets by offering a greater diversity of scenes, varying personnel behaviors, flexible capture angles, differing capture heights, and an inclusion of aligned visible and infrared samples along with synthetic samples.
