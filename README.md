# VTSaR Dataset
we have conducted a comprehensive APD dataset labeled as
24 ”VTSaR”, which stands out from the existing publicly accessible APD datasets by offering a
25 greater diversity of scenes, varying personnel behaviors, flexible capture angles, differing capture
26 heights, and an inclusion of aligned visible and infrared samples along with synthetic samples.
